# Integration-Methods-MATLAB
Coursework solution for the Computational Methods module. The task was to develop 4 algorithms to estimate the integral of a function using the Newton-Cotes methods.(Gaussian, Rectangular, Trapezium, and Simpson)
Check the report file, as it explains most of the code and answers further questions about Integration methods.
